# FJones Personal training

## Introduction

The primary goal of this webpage is to serve as a platform for my friend's business. Currently, my friend does not have a website and relies on word-of-mouth to build his client base. This site aims to offer an engaging and informative introduction to his qualifications, experience, and training philosophy. It will also provide details about one-on-one training sessions, group training, nutritional guidance and customised workout plans. Additionally, the webpage will feature a booking system and accessible contact options, making it easy for potential clients to reach out, ask questions, and schedule consultations.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I used a colour image picker to select colours from the logo, ensuring consistent colour usage across the webpage. To create visually appealing design, i chose a dark background, accented with purple to highlight specific elements. The use of purple can help reinforce brand identity and can make key components stand out to engage users.
