## Personal trainer webpage

## Introduction

The primary goal of this webpage is to serve as a platform for my friend's business. Currently, my friend does not have a website and relies on word-of-mouth to build his client base. This site aims to offer an engaging and informative introduction to his qualifications, experience, and training philosophy. It will also provide details about one-on-one training sessions, group training, nutritional guidance and customised workout plans. Additionally, the webpage will feature a booking system and accessible contact options, making it easy for potential clients to reach out, ask questions, and schedule consultations.
